<h3>In 2013 the City of San Diego <strong>had an interesting opportunity</strong>.</h3>

<p>In 2013 we worked with the Code for America Brigade in San Diego and the City Council Infrastructure Committee to improve the City’s Capital Improvement Site. The site was not very user-friendly and the map required a third-party plugin to be usable.  </p>

<p>We used <strong>agile development</strong> principles to develop fast and iterate as often as possible. The project and all of its project management is <strong>open source</strong> and <strong>transparent</strong>. We reorganised the data and added small visualizations for a quick overview and removed terminology that citizens don’t understand. The information provided is more detailed and comprehensive than before.  </p>

<p><em>The result was a nice and easy to use map and small visualizations. The new site has a clear focus on usability and helps citizen answer basic questions about Capital Improvement Projects.</em></p>

<p>Mila and I worked together on the CIP Civic Engagement App for the <strong>Council Infrastructure Committee</strong> with CM Mark Kersey. He proved himself to be an <strong>excellent and detail oriented</strong> developer with a strong grasp on both the fundamentals of iterative <strong>test driven development</strong> and automated deployment as well <strong>user centric design</strong>. He brings a broad range of skills in other areas to the table that would benefit any project or initiative. It was my pleasure to work with him and look forward to collaborating on other projects in the future.</p>

<h3><strong>RESULTS</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>Increase your audience engagement up to 30%</li>
<li>Increase the time spent on your site up to 100%</li>
<li>Effectively communicate your story with data</li>
</ul>

<p>According to studies by infogram and D.C. Thomson data visualizations can increase the engagement of your audience.<br>
The study showed a 15-30% increase in comments and shares. As well as a 60-100% increase in time spent on the site.  </p>

<p>Increaes audience engagement and time spent on your site will result in more donations and will spread your message more widely. Engagements in sharing your story via social media will increase your reach across your target audience.</p>

<h3>Data Source Research</h3>

<p>With 30 minutes spent looking over your cause together, we can find more sources of data you can use to reach the right people. After 30 minutes on the phone or Skype with me, you will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Understand how data can help you reach more influencers</li>
<li>Have a list of three or more places to find data</li>
<li>Have a list of ideas how to improve your messaging</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll have to move fast, of course, to get through all this in 30 minutes but don’t worry, I’ll keep us on track. To receive your meeting agenda and scheduling instructions, click the button.</p>
