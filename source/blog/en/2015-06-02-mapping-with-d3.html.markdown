I held a workshop about *"mapping in d3"* at the last FOSSGIS 2015 in MÃ¼nster.  

The workshop consisted of three main challenges and two extra challenges.  

__The topics covered were:__  

  - Creating a simple map from both geojson and topojson  
  - Changing the projection of the map  
  - Adding interaction to the map  
    - Creating a tooltip  
    - Adding mouseover effect  
  - Creating a choroplet map  
  - adding labels  


The workshop duration was an hour and I tried to help the participants to create basic maps with d3.

You can find the challenges [here](https://github.com/CivicVision/mapping_in_d3/tree/master/challenges) and the presentation is available [here](http://civicvision.de/mapping_in_d3).
