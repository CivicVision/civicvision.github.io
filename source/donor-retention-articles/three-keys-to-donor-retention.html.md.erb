Not every donor will be retained. But you should try. Average non-profits retain about __50%__ of their donors. Successful ones retained about __80%__. Research shows that the key to increasing your donor retention rate is to build relationships with your donors. Keep in touch with them. Show them the results you accomplish with their money. And most important: thank them. And thank them often.

## Keep in touch with them.

Your donors need to hear from you. Consistently, and not only when you ask for another donation. Write them an email, a postcard, a letter, send them something nice. It does not have to be fancy. Just keep in touch. Remind them and yourself that they support your cause. If you show up consistently and build trust by sending them something just for them the next donation ask will be much easier.

According to a Bloomerang study __9%__ of your donors will leave because they don’t remember giving. And __18%__ of donors will leave due to poor service or communication (_Bloomerang, “Nonprofit Donor Loyalty Primer”_).

__That's why you should:__

- Write them consistently
- Build trust by showing up
- Don’t just ask for new donations. Care about them!

## Thank them

If you write them, don’t forget to thank them. Everyone appreciates a thank you, especially donors. They helped you with money, the least you can do, is to say thank you.
Thank them early, right after their donation, and thank them often, at least seven times, as studies show.
Personalize the thank you. Do not send a generic thank you. Find out as much as you can about them and include it in your touch points.

The Bloomerang study states that __13%__ of donors leave because the nonprofit didn’t say thanks _(Bloomerang, “Nonprofit Donor Loyalty Primer”)._

__That's why you should:__

- Thank them promptly
- Thank them often
- Personalize your thank you

## Show them results

If you keep in touch with them and thank them, include some progress on your projects. Donors want to know where they money is being used. If you can, show them photos or a video, add testimonials from people you helped or volunteers that worked on that project. Tell them success and impact stories. Use the storytelling technique if you can, donors want to read stories. Take it from Seth Godin:

> The story's about the donor. Every time someone donates to a good cause, they're buying a story, a story that’s worth more than the amount they donated. It might be the story of doing the right thing, or fitting in, or pleasing a friend or honoring a memory, but the story has value. For many, it's the story of what it means to be part of a community.

The Burk Donor Survey shows that a top requirement (__75%__ of participants) for future giving is _"information on results achieved with their gifts"_. (_The Burk Donor Survey. Cygnus Applied Research, Inc. 2013_)

__That's why you should:__

- Show them progress
- Share success stories
- Show where their money is spent

## Let them know you care

If you don't show that you care, they will leave. The top reasons why they will leave according to research:

- __46% of donors leave for reasons tied to lack of meaningful info or to a feeling their giving is not appreciated__ (_Penelope Burk, Donor-Centered Fundraising_).
- __53% of donors decide not to renew due to the lack of proper communication by the organisation__ (_Bloomerang, “Nonprofit Donor Loyalty Primer” Infographic via Dr. Adrian Sargent, “Managing Donor Defection”_).

__That's why you should:__

- Keep in touch with them
- Thank them
- Show them results

The key to keeping them loyal is to show them that you care about them.
Implement these items, and you will see results. Don't expect them to donate right away; it will take time. Probably a year, but they will stick around for much longer.
