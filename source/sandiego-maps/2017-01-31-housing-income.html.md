I'm in the middle of creating a series of maps to be used for a more detailed story about affordable housing in San Diego. 
I will post the intermediate results here and will update these posts with more information while I investigate more and find interesting stories.

## 30% or more of household income for housing

I will need to look at trends here and compare with older data and maybe other cities to find out if this is specific to San Diego or America.
I'm suprised by the number of 16 tracts where > 70% of the people use 30% of their income for housing. 

### Census Tract 95.11, San Diego, CA

This tract has the highest percentage of people spending more than 30% of their income for housing.  
Unbelivalble **82 %**

A few facts about this tract:

- **Neighborhood**: Tierrasanta
- **Population**: 4,324
- **Median Age**: 14.9 (about two-fifths of the figure in San Diego)
- **Per capita income**: 13,907 (about two-fifths of the amount in San Diego)
- 100% **renters**
- 68% **Single-unit structures**
- 23.7% **veterans** (more than double the rate in San Diego)
