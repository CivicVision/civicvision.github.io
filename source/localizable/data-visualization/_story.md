### In 2014 BICC **had an interesting opportunity**.

Their data was hidden in a map that was neither easy nor intuitive to use. We helped them update the map and increase the usabitlity.  
By reorganising the data and highlighting the important aspects of the dataset the map was **easier to use**.  
By adding small visual clues we **helped the user** to know what to do and expect.  
Through the use of new technology the map loaded faster and was more beautiful.  
The challenge was to get as much information as possible on this visualization but **donâ€™t overwhelm the user**. We solved this by using color and font sizes to highlighting the key parts and still have enough room left to display all information that was needed.  

*The result was a fast, easy to use new data visualization that not only had the map with its information but small little visual clues to make it easier to read.*
