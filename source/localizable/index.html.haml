        As an 
        %b advocacy group,
        you want to reach as many (influential) people as possible with your message.
      %p
        Your best vehicles are
        %i news articles
        about your efforts,
        %i reports
        you send out to the media, the public and influencers and 
        %i blog posts.
    %p.text-2xl.mt-4.font-bold.text-grey-dark 
      You want people to read your messages and spread your insights.

      %p.mb-4
        Unfortunately, research shows that more and more people only scan articles instead of reading them thoroughly. Studies also show that people spent less time reading on the internet in general. On top of that, most of them will only read the text that is visible without scrolling.
      %p.mb-4
        It is frustrating for you because you rely on people to read your point of view and spread your message. 
      %p.mb-8
        Furthermore, getting the best media coverage is harder nowadays. Journalists have less time and more to write about, there is generally more content to consume and media outlets compete with the general internet.

        Does this sound familiar to you:

            = partial "partials/close_icon", locals: { classNames: "self-start" }
            %span
              Your audience spends
              %b less time
              on your website and reports
        %li
          .flex.w-full.px-3.items-start.my-2.sm:m-0
            = partial "partials/close_icon", locals: { classNames: "self-start" }
            %span.self-start
              the media 
              %b does not report 
              about your key findings
        %li 
          .flex.w-full.px-3.items-center.my-2.sm:m-0
            = partial "partials/close_icon", locals: { classNames: "self-start" }
            %span
              your well crafted-reports gets
              %b dismissed 
              by influencers and the media
        %li 
          .flex.w-full.px-3.items-center.my-2.sm:m-0
            = partial "partials/close_icon", locals: { classNames: "self-start" }
            %span
              your report 
              %b does not get shared 
              on social media and therefore decreases its reach
