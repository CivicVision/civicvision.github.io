### **The Solution is Surprisingly Simple**

We use the power of email automation to engage your donors and increase the likelihood of a new donation. This proven technique is called donor on boarding.

The on boarding consists of automated, personalized email sequences withthe following topics:

- __Thank you sequence,__ Thank your donors more than once.
- __Present your organization,__ Tell them more about yourself.
- __Where is the money spent,__ Tell them on what their donation is being used for.
- __Ask your donors questions,__ Why they donated? What they are hoping to see in your organization, etc.

Studies have shown that on boarding your new donors will increase the likelihood of new donations. Telling them what you do and how the money is spent will engage them more with your organization and increases again the likelihood of new donations.
