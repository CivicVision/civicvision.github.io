### In 2013 the City of San Diego **had an interesting opportunity**.

In 2013 we worked with the Code for America Brigade in San Diego and the City Council Infrastructure Committee to improve the City’s Capital Improvement Site. The site was not very user-friendly and the map required a third-party plugin to be usable.  

We used **agile development** principles to develop fast and iterate as often as possible. The project and all of its project management is **open source** and **transparent**. We reorganised the data and added small visualizations for a quick overview and removed terminology that citizens don’t understand. The information provided is more detailed and comprehensive than before.  

*The result was a nice and easy to use map and small visualizations. The new site has a clear focus on usability and helps citizen answer basic questions about Capital Improvement Projects.*
