      ### __Hi there__,
      My name is Mila Frerichs and I’m a Data Consultant and Data Visualization expert.

      I help civic advocacy groups and non-profits increase their engagement and influence by creating interactive data visualizations and data stories.  I have worked with governments as well, creating budget visualizations.

      I worked with organizations such as Code for America and the Open Knowledge Foundation. In my free-time I work on civic issues for the City of San Diego and Berlin in the Code for American Brigade network.

       I’d love the opportunity to help you take your organisation to the next level if things are a good fit for my expertise. Take a look at some of the examples below and then let’s chat.

      Thanks.
