  ### __Hi Veronica__,

  I would like to respond to your post on [idealist.com](https://www.idealist.org/en/consultant-job/2e273bd7c0444d9ebc87915ee024ec07-senior-developer-w-data-visualization-experience-eviction-lab-new-york).

  My name is Mila Frerichs, and I’m a Data Consultant and Data Visualization expert.

  Your cause advocating for affordable housing and working on ways to prevent eviction hits home for me. Helping struggling communities with my skills was always something I want to do. 

  I help civic non-profits like yours increase their engagement and influence by creating interactive data visualizations and data stories. 

  I worked with organizations such as [Code for America](https://codeforamerica.org) and the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.de) on similar projects. In my free-time, I work on civic issues for the City of San Diego and Berlin in the Code for American Brigade network.

  I’ve worked in web agencies for several years building complex web applications with Rails and on Frontend Javascript applications before founding my own company. 
  I worked with larger teams on Open Source projects since launching my business, with clients like Boundless on MapStory and Boundless Exchange (Geonode).
  I’m very focused on process and in every project I’m involved added Tests, Continuous Integration and if possible Continuous Deployment.
  I use GitHub extensively including GitHub Issues to track issues and organize them into milestones.

  I worked with Raster, and Vector tiles with Leaflet and OpenLayers on several projects and most projects are deployed via Docker on AWS using EC2 and S3 for storage.

  I’m working with Javascript professionally for more than eight years and with frameworks such as Angular, React, Knockout. 

  You can find my CV here:

  Would love to be involved in the creation of the first-ever nationwide database of eviction statistics and create engaging and educating data visualizations with that data.
